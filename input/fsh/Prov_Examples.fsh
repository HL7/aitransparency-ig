/* Note that FHIR R6 has a Provenance example of a MolecularSequence recorded by a Biocompute object
 https://build.fhir.org/provenance-example-biocompute-object.html
 Yet this example has an agent of Practitioner/f007, rather than a Device.
 I have taken that example and modified it to indicate that the Biocompute object was the AI system providing input to the MolecularSequence.
