### Use Case 1: AI Attribution in Clinical or Administrative Documentation Review

Clinicians reviewing previous treatment plans must distinguish between content inferred by AI, decisions assisted by AI, and those made without AI involvement. This parallels standard practice of identifying the human clinician responsible for treatment plans, their role in development, and their clinical background.

Moreover, the use case can be expanded to different roles and contexts, as shown in the table below:

<style>
table {
    border-collapse: collapse;
    width: 100%;
}

table, th, td {
    border: 1px solid #999999;
}

th, td {
    padding: 8px;
    text-align: left;
}

th {
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
}
</style>
