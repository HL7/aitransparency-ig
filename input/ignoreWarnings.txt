WARNING: Observation/glasgow: Observation.value.ofType(Quantity): UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {score} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked, and the Quantity.unit SHOULD contain the annotation
